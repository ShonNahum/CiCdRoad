# 📄 Jaeger in My DevOps CI/CD Project

## 📌 Why I Use Jaeger

**Jaeger** is my go-to solution for **distributed tracing**. It helps me understand how requests flow across services in my microservices architecture.

Here's why it's essential in my setup:

- 🧩 Built by **CNCF** and designed for **cloud-native** environments.
- 🔍 Tracks the full lifecycle of a request across services (spans, traces).
- ⚙️ Helps diagnose bottlenecks, errors, and performance issues in real-time.
- 🚀 Supports **OpenTelemetry** and integrates with my SM/SMC apps over **gRPC (OTLP)**.
- 📈 Connects easily with **Grafana** using the Jaeger data source.

## 🛠️ How Jaeger Fits Into My Workflow

### 🔁 Tracing Flow

- My applications (**SM**, **SMC**) use **OpenTelemetry SDKs** to instrument code and export traces.
- These traces are sent via **gRPC using OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol)** to the **Jaeger Collector** on port `4317`.
- Jaeger temporarily stores the traces in memory.
- **Grafana** reads the trace data Directly from **Jaeger** (via REST API),
- viewing traces at **Grafana**

## 🌐 Jaeger Ports Explained

I expose the following ports:

| Port  | Purpose                                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `16686` | 🌐 Jaeger UI – Web interface to explore traces |
| `4317`  | 🔗 OTLP/gRPC – Applications send traces here   |
| `14269` | 📊 Health & metrics endpoint (Prometheus scrape target) |

These ports enable:
- My apps to push trace data via OTLP/gRPC (`4317`).
- Me to view and search traces in the Jaeger Web UI (`16686`). (it's optional becuase i use grafana to view and search traces)
- External monitoring tools to check Jaeger's health (`14269`).

## 📡 What is gRPC (in this context)?

- **gRPC** is a high-performance, open-source protocol by Google.
- It enables **efficient communication** between services using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.
- In my setup:
  - My apps send traces using **gRPC OTLP exporters**.
  - The data goes to the **Jaeger Collector**, which listens on `4317` (gRPC endpoint).

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Jaeger gives me:

- 📈 Full **visibility into distributed systems** and service interactions.
- 🔎 Root cause analysis for slow or failed requests.
- 📦 Lightweight, fast tracing with **gRPC-based delivery**.
- 🔗 Integration with **Grafana**, Prometheus, and Loki for a complete observability stack.

Jaeger is a core part of my DevOps observability pipeline, enabling me to **trace requests**, **optimize performance**, and **debug issues faster** across complex systems.
